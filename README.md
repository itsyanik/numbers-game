# numbers-game
This is the first project I ever made when working for a school. By the time I was still a student and didn't know much so there is a lot to be fixed in here. I decided to remake this project using the knowledge I have nowadays because I remember having fun while doing it.

The `bot.js` file was meant to be used as a testing method for the progress of the game as it does all the clicking on it's own.

To avoid any complications I am removing any image related to that school, so some images will be broken. But this will be fixed as I work in the new version as well as moving everything to english.

I'm also using this project as proof that I can work with tags in the current company I am.

## about
This game is meant to be used to teaching kids into learning the numeric order and also to understand how dozens work. 

Since the game itself lacks instructions as the ones who were going to play were taught it in class, I'm leaving some basic instructions here:

You start by picking up the range of numbers you want to work with. Then it will lead you to a new screen with all the numbers from that range sorted into a random order and you have to click it in order. If you fail to follow the order the game ends, and if you succeed you win.

It is a very basic game.
